# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is based on emotion and opinion extraction of people about particular topic. For this project, I have used "IMDB movie review" dataset (Link for dataset-https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews). Aim of this project is to interprete and classify emotions(positive,negative and neutral) from IMDB movie reviews dataset.For this classification, I have used "Natural Language Processsing (NLP)" and "Logistic Regression" model which is giving "89.47%" accuracy.
